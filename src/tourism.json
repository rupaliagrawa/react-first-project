        "para":"For decades, Washington, D.C., was a destination that left people wanting more.  The infrastructure of Washington, D.C., was built for people to get into the office quickly, do their jobs, and get home. There weren’t that many attractions: people were there to work or learn, not to play. But over the last 15 years, all of that has changed. Neighborhoods that were once struggling to sustain viable businesses are now flourishing, and people are flocking to the capital of the United States for vacation. And there is far more to do than drive past 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
        "para1":"Most people assume that D.C. is a place people live for a political cycle, but there are actually several native locals living in the city, and they’re very proud of it. Most of these people are true locals, and not the people making headlines every week. Politics are obviously a big part of Washington, D.C., but at the end of the day, it only represents a portion of what’s going on there.",
        "para2":"Natives’ lives are often as distanced from the political buzz as people living throughout the country, and they may only see the Washington Monument or drive past Capitol Hill on occasion. Many native D.C. dwellers have invested in building up their communities and have begun to transform their neighborhoods.",

        "para":"One of the most important historic features of the city of Agra is the gardens that line the banks of the Yamuna River. Sanctuaries of respite from the city’s heat and sites of veneration to honor the deceased, the gardens were created over a period of more than 100 years. The Taj Mahal, across the Yamuna River from the gardens, is thus part of a larger cultural context that represents an important example of Mughal landscape traditions. The extensive written and pictorial historical record shows that from the time of Emperor Babur (r. 1526–30) through the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1627–58) the riverfront was densely covered by walled enclosures, buildings, pavilions, and lush gardens. Today, more than 40 Mughal gardens survive in ranging states of conservation, all having been significantly changed over time. Four are under the management of the Archaeological Survey of India. These gardens may not be as well known to travelers as the Taj Mahal, but they are open to the public and represent an extraordinary ensemble of Mughal heritage, as well as providing recreational spaces in a bustling urban environment."

        "para":"The Preah Khan temple complex situated at the northern edge of the Angkor Archaeological Park is one of the most significant buildings erected during the ancient Khmer empire. Dedicated by the great king Jayavarman VII to his father in 1191, Preah Khan serves today as an outstanding example of a large linear temple complex in a dense jungle setting. Rectangular in shape and occupying 138 acres, Preah Khan’s boundaries are defined by a protective moat and fortified walls adorned by monumental carved stone garudas—eagle-like divine beings. The temple complex includes entryways, towers, ceremonial spaces, courtyards, shrines, and a variety of connecting corridors. Additional special features of Preah Khan include its two-story pavilion, the once-bronze-plated sanctum sanctorum, and its Hall of Dancers."

        "para":"Shwe-nandaw Kyaung dates to the mid-nineteenth century. Believed to be originally part of the royal palace at Amarapura, it was moved to Mandalay and, with the name Mya Nan San Kyaw, became part of King Mindon-Min’s apartments at Mandalay palace complex. In the 1880s, soon after the King’s death, his son King Thibaw moved the structure to its present location, refurbishing it as a monastery. Significantly, the moving saved the building from the bombing of Mandalay during World War II, which destroyed most of the buildings of King Mindon-Min’s palace. The relocated Shwe-nandaw Kyaung is the only surviving wooden structure of that complex, featuring a unique gilded interior with extensive and intricate woodcarvings, unrivaled in their intricacy. In fact, Shwe-nandaw Kyaung is considered one of the most beautiful monasteries in Myanmar, and it is also one of the highest visited tourist sites in the country.",
        "para2":"Wooden monasteries were once ubiquitous features of Myanmar’s landscape and important aspects of the country’s cultural heritage. Each village had its own monastery with variations in appearance and ornamentation that reflected local vernacular styles. However, many of the teakwood monastic buildings in Myanmar are endangered due to lack of maintenance or unsympathetic restorations, an issue emphasized by the rareness and high cost of teak wood and the loss of craftsmanship."

        "para":"Lalibela is located approximately 370 miles (600 kilometers) north of Addis Ababa in the Amhara Region, situated at an altitude of 8,200 feet (2,500 meters). In its center lies a unique complex of 11 churches cut out of the living rock some 800 years ago. Their construction is attributed to King Lalibela (approximately 1181-1221), of the Zagwe dynasty, who attempted to create a new Jerusalem on African soil, accessible to all Ethiopians. Even the names of Lalibela’s features echo those of Jerusalem: the river Jordan, the church of Golgotha, and the Tomb of Adam. The churches are still used for daily worship and special ceremonies, receiving pilgrims and large crowds during holidays such as Christmas and Easter. The churches, inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1978, are sculpted out of solid volcanic rock and are often connected by long underground tunnels and trenches. The main cluster of 11 churches is divided in two groups: a northern group with five churches and an eastern group with another five, while Biet Gyorgis, perhaps the most famous, is an isolated church."

        "para":"The best way to experience the timelessness of Varanasi, one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities, is to start just before dawn breaks. At Assi Ghat on the Ganges, the devotional Ganga Aarti ceremony will mesmerize as participants intone rhythmic chants and hymns on steps that descend to the holy river. Next, take to the water in a small boat, watching the sun rise as life slowly starts to stir along the river.",
        "para2":"Suddenly, there will be a burst of activity as saffron-clad sadhus (holy men), vendors, devotees, and tourists begin performing rituals, including yoga and singing. A 2-hour boat ride across the Ganges will pass the main Dashashwamedh Ghat toward Manikarnika Ghat, where funeral pyres burn as the dead are cremated. In Varanasi, death is a way of life."
